# CITS3403_GroupProject
Our group project for CITS3403. Group Members: Jeffrey Peng, Elizabeth Shibu, Ryan Koo, Ethan van Bruchem.

# Our Project - "Wild Puzzles"
We are making a nonogram puzzle (and potentially other puzzles) sharing site.
Users will be able to create nonogram puzzles, share them with others, and solve others' puzzles.
We will have solving tools to give hints, including an auto-solving program server-side, which will verify uniqueness of solution.
