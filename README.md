# CITS3403_GroupProject
Our group project for CITS3403. Group Members: Jeffrey Peng, Elizabeth Shibu, Ryan Koo, Ethan van Bruchem.

# Our Project - working name "Wild Puzzles"
We are making a nonogram puzzle (and potentially other puzzles) sharing site.
Users will be able to create nonogram puzzles, share them with others, and solve others' puzzles.
We will have solving tools to give hints, including an auto-solving program server-side, which will verify uniqueness of solution.

# Meetings
## Initial Meeting 4 Apr
We met each other and discussed ideas for the project, before reaching the conclusion of a nonogram solver.

## Second Meeting 11 Apr
We came up with a list of tasks we each need to do, which are visible on the picture of the whiteboard uploaded to the main folder of this repository.
We agreed to complete these tasks by our next meeting, scheduled for 17 Apr (since 18 Apr is a public holiday).

## Third Meeting 17 Apr
We agreed on which pages would be created in the website (and basic routing for the backend).
We assigned tasks to various group members, to ideally be able to meet the first deliverable by our next meeting, which will be a Teams meeting on 24 Apr.
These are available in the screenshot in the Written Discussions from Team Meetings folder.
