We set up the finished server containing what we believe to be the final number of 11 pages.

We pull requested, and got everyone to code review inside the meeting so that the pull request could be merged quickly.

We agreed to have a 48-hour time limit on pull requests for the sake of time: if only 2/3 approvals there by 48 hours after pull request, just do it.

Tasks to do for next meeting:
Ryan) Make database using python and SQLite3 for Users and Friends
Ethan) Make Puzzles database
Elizabeth) Fix styling of all pages such that they look consistent
Jeffrey) Fix intra-site links to point to the correct server route

Next meeting Friday 11am, right after the lecture.
